The former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister added the public will no longer be misled by such promises as these are considered as ‘hoax’. “The people of the country are suffering from inflation, poverty, unemployment and corruption. But both the Congress and the BJP are trying to capitalise on caste census, OBC and women reservation ahead of the elections so that they can cover up their failures. But the public will no longer be misled as they will consider it a hoax,” she added. ",1.0

"India’s first law enforcement Chief Information Security Officers’ (CISO) council was launched by DGP Anjani Kumar and Principal Secretary Jayesh Ranjan at the Cyberabad Police Commissionerate on Saturday. The CISO council will partner with public and private institutions to tackle cyber security threat in real time.The State police, with the support of industry and academia, launched the CISO council, in the presence of secretary for Society for Cyberabad Security Council (SCSC) Ramesh Kaza.“The definition of crime is changing fast. Cyber criminals operate remotely without any geographical constraints,” said Mr. Kumar during the launch.“This poses a lot of challenges for the police. The rate at which cyber crimes are rising, $8 trillion will be lost to cyber crimes by the end of 2023, which is almost a third of the GDP of the United States in 2022 and twice as much as India’s projected GDP this year,” he said.“The CISO council will be a beacon of cyber security in Telangana. It is the best example of Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model that we often talk about. Cyber security breaches are multiplying and will grow by leaps and bounds when the next billion internet users start going digital. The enterprises are also going to be at risk,” said Mr. Ranjan.He cited an example of his meeting with Ajay Banga, formerly with Master Cards, who shared that the company in the US was subjected to 10,000 cyber attacks in a day and that the number would go up to 30,000 attempts.Mr. Ranjan asked the CISO council to work with the IT department and a few Centres of Excellence in the State such as Security Operations Centre, Cyber Security Centre of Excellence, Data Security Council of India and Computer Emergency Response Team. “The CISO council should work with start-ups as they are known for innovative and agile thinking and are tools of development, apart from engaging ethical hackers,” he said.“With a 300% increase in cyber crime cases in the last one year, we need to get our defence strong to tackle online crooks,” said Cyberabad Police Commissioner Stephen Raveendra.“Government organisations, critical infrastructure, and industry, including vulnerable MSMEs, are repeatedly besieged by threats and are ill-equipped to handle it, compared to their larger multinational counterparts. The recent targeted attacks on the government and critical infrastructure institutions during the G20 event in Delhi highlights the imminent need to institutionalise the fight against cyber threats,” he said.Mr. Kaza said that ransomware attacks are up by 200%, especially password-based attacks. “This year, approximately 1,56,000 daily BEC (Business Email Compromise) attempts were observed. Attacks targeting open-source software have grown by an average 742%.

" The IAF will unveil its new ensign at the annual Air Force Day parade at Prayagraj on Sunday to better reflect its values, 72 years after a similar exercise was undertaken.The Indian Air Force's move comes over a year after the Navy made changes in its ensign shedding its colonial past.""October 8 will go down as a momentous day in the annals of IAF history. On this historic day, the Chief of Air Staff will unveil the new IAF ensign,"" the IAF said.In the new ensign, the Indian Air Force crest will be in the top right corner.The Indian Air Force was officially established on 8 October, 1932. In view of its professional efficiency and achievements during World War II, the force was bestowed with the prefix ""Royal"" in March 1945. So, it became the Royal Indian Air Force (RIAF).In 1950, the IAF dropped its ""Royal"" prefix and amended the ensign as India became a republic.The RIAF ensign consisted of the Union Jack in the upper left canton and the RIAF roundel (red, white and blue) on the fly side. Post-Independence, the IAF ensign was created by replacing the Union Jack with the Indian tricolour and the RAF roundels with the IAF tricolour roundel in the lower right canton.""A new lAF ensign has now been created to better reflect the values of the Indian Air Force. This reaffirmation will now be reflected by the inclusion of the Air Force Crest in the top right corner of the ensign, towards the fly side,"" the IAF said in a statement.The IAF crest has the national symbol, the Ashoka lion on the top with the words 'Satyameva Jayate' in Devanagari below it.Below the Ashoka lion is a Himalayan eagle with its wings spread, denoting the fighting qualities of the IAF.A ring in light blue colour encircles the Himalayan eagle  with the words 'Bhartiya Vayu Sena.The motto of the IAF -- 'touch the sky with the glory' is inscribed below Himalayan eagle in Devanagari.The IAF motto has been taken from verse 24, Chapter 11 of the Bhagavad Gita and means ""Radiant Thou Touchest Heaven"" or in other words ""touching the sky with glory"".The Air Force Day parade and air display will be held in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh.Chief of Defence Staff Gen Anil Chauhan and Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhari are among top military officials attending the event.The parade was traditionally held at the Hindon airbase near Delhi till 2021 before the event was taken outside the national capital.

"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have provided an opportunity to a set of women in rural Assam to make their grounded dreams take flight again. Meet Riju Begum, Romina Begum, Himadri Talukdar, Ritumoni Kalita, Rinku Moni Medhi, and Minakhi Barman – six of 40 members of women’s self-help groups (SHGs) who qualified for arguably the first short-term gender-specific course in India to operate, maintain, and repair UAVs or drones. They concluded their six-day training on Saturday, confident of adding wings to their mundane lives. Riju, 30, and Romina, 25, both from Nalbari district’s Barnagar Banekuchi village, are members of Sanjibani SHG and Maya SHG respectively. Social and economic pressures prevented them from pursuing their education beyond class 10, the former now a marginal farmer and the latter a daily-wage labourer. Their SHGs, into agriculture and allied activities, helped augment their family incomes but not to the extent they would have liked. “The course has made us realise technology can open up a world of opportunities for us. There are a range of agriculture services we never knew can be handled from the air,” Romina said. A member of Jonaki SHG in the same district’s Raimadha village, the 27-year-old Ritumoni graduated in humanities about five years ago. She hopes handling drones will now help her “graduate” from being a daily-wage labourer. The 31-year-old Rinku Moni of Narayanpur village’s Swagata SHG graduated in humanities too. As a homemaker, she has been better off than the other trainees but the urge to “do something on my own” made her sign up for the course. “Some of the trainees have a polytechnic background but by getting selected for the course, what all of them have conveyed is that it is important to at least complete school and have the urge to upgrade,” Krishna Baruah, the mission director of the Assam State Rural Livelihood Mission (ARSLM) said. The ARSLM collaborated with the Nalbari district administration headed by Deputy Commissioner Varnali Deka for the drone pilot and technology training at Nalbari Polytechnic in Chandkuchi, a village near Nalbari town about 70 km northwest of Guwahati. The Assam government subsequently decided to provide loans and training to the members of 15,000 SHGs for operating and repairing drones. “The Central and State governments are significant users of UAV applications. Once trained, these women SHG members will have ample opportunities as UAV pilots in agriculture, horticulture, healthcare, medicine deliver awareness campaigns, and even as drone trainers,” she said. Jayanta Malla Baruah, Assam’s Minister for Skill, Employment and Entrepreneurship said the DGCA-certified drone training could go a long way in making women SHGs self-reliant and opening up employment opportunities in multiple sectors. “We need at least 1 lakh drone operators to handle various government and non-government activities, even plant seeds and fertilise fields. We are also working on courses for advanced machinery operations for a range of specialised jobs,” he said. ",1.0
"Developed in India and consisting of a set of “mini-cubes” which can be airlifted and deployed on any terrain, the “world’s first portable disaster hospital” is now ready to be shared with the world.“This easy-to-use, mobile medical facility can be swiftly deployed to save lives in the most challenging circumstances. It can provide critical medical care to 100 survivors for up to 48 hours, making it a lifeline on remote and tough terrains where immediate medical attention is needed. The cubes [which are self-sustained healthcare units] can handle bullet, burn, head, spinal and chest injuries, fractures, and major bleeding. India is now equipped and ready to supply this to any country in need,” confirmed a senior Health Ministry official.He added that it can also provide help for tactical combat casualty care, massive haemorrhage, and hypothermia. The portable hospital was developed as part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ambitious ‘Project BHISHMA’ (Bharat Health Initiative for Sahyog Hita and Maitri) and consists of a fully equipped operation theatre, mini-ICUs, ventilators, blood-testing equipment, an X-ray machine, and even a cooking station. It also includes a shelter facility and power generator, making it entirely self-sufficient during emergencies. The life-saving equipment are packed in a set of “mini-cubes” and a combination of these mini-cubes is used to set up a mobile hospital capable of performing life-saving surgery. The mini-cubes are carried in a “Aarogya Maitri Cube Cage”, which has three frames, each accommodating 12 mini-cubes. An Aarogya Maitri Cube Cage can fit 36 mini-cubes overall.  Two such ‘Aarogya Maitri’ mother cubes combine to form a “brick” to complete the kit which is also water- and corrosion-proof. The kit also comes with a unique locking and tamper-proof system which is easy to locate, draw-out and use. It can be dismantled in various combinations based on availability of space.The Health Ministry official added that under this initiative, India is now equipped to provide critical medical supplies to developing countries grappling with the aftermath of natural disasters or humanitarian emergencies.Spearheaded by HLL Life Care, the government’s designated agency for sourcing the kit, and manufactured by multiple sellers collaborating to provide a diverse range of essential medical products, this project was initiated in 2022 through the Ministry of Defence.Meanwhile, India is also actively considering its deployment in remote tribal areas and has already gifted these units as a goodwill gesture to Sri Lanka and Myanmar.

"The Territorial Army (TA) has inducted five Chinese language interpreters in August to assist the Army at Border Personnel Meetings (BPM) with China, defence sources said. Also, there are plans for the recruitment of cyber experts. As part of the overall force reorganisation, the Army is in deliberations with the TA to convert some of the regular units, primarily logistics-related, into TA battalions, in order to bring down financial outflow, sources said. “The process for recruitment of Chinese language interpreters started in January and they were inducted in August. Five interpreters were recruited as per the Army’s requirement,” a defence source said. On the recruitment of cyber experts, the source said that deliberations were under way. The criteria for selection have been finalised and approval taken, and sanction for the proposal is expected by the end of the month. On the conversion of some regular Army units into TA battalions, the sources said talks are in preliminary stages and once the sanction is received, a pilot project would be undertaken with a few units. The TA, which is a citizens’ force raised by an Act of Parliament in 1948, currently has 60 units, of which 14 are deployed in counter insurgency duties in support of the Army and two units are in the Andaman and Nicobar islands. It also has departmental TA battalions funded by the Ministries of Environment and Forests, Jal Shakti, Railways and Petroleum. TA Units were deployed to support the Army in eastern Ladakh as part of Operation Snow Leopard at the peak of the stand-off with China in 2020, sources noted. Similarly, in May, as the crisis unfolded in Manipur, the TA oil units stepped in and took control of oil installations that were not operational and augmented manpower in order to ensure supplies of essential petroleum and oil products and refuelling of aircraft. Certain units are also deployed in conjunction with the Border Roads Organisation and Ministry of Railways for protection of under-construction road and rail alignments in remote and sensitive areas, the source stated. Two new ecological battalions are set to be raised in Maharashtra later this month on the request of the State government. The first Ecological Task Force (ETF) was raised in 1982, to protect the severely degraded hills of Mussoorie (Uttarakhand) due to intensive and incessant limestone quarrying and deforestation. Today, there are 10 ecological battalions deployed across the country. Various ETFs have jointly planted approximately 9.38 crore saplings in approximately 88,400 hectares across the country and also constructed 29 new water bodies besides rejuvenating many existing ones, officials said. A specialised TA ecological battalion, the Ganga Task Force, has been working on the conservation and rejuvenation of the Ganga in conjunction with the Ministry of Jal Shakti as part of the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG). They also help to prevent soil erosion, patrol ghats to prevent illegal activities and assist in curbing pollution. The unit personnel have also been employed in New Delhi to assist in the ongoing efforts to control pollution in the Yamuna, sources said. These TA battalions also undertake tree plantation and have annual target of 40-45 lakh trees. Land has to be given by State forest departments. The saplings are looked after for 3-5 years and the survivability rate is 80-85%.  Earlier, there were six TA railway battalions, however with technological advancements and changing requirements, the Ministry has decided to disband four of them, sources said.  The TA has also begun inducting women officers since 2019 and currently they are serving with TA oil sector units and TA railway engineer regiments. Based on the experience gained during this period, a proposal has been prepared to extend the employment scope further, the source stated. ",1.0
"GUWAHATIThe Manipur government has asked organisations and individuals in the State not to change the names of “districts, sub-divisions, places, institutions, and addresses of such institutions” on their own to create possible conflict between communities.The order issued by Chief Secretary Vineet Joshi on October 5 but released Friday night warned of “appropriate actions” according to the law if any organisation or individual is found involved in such renaming.There have been instances of some organisations changing the names of districts, places, and institutions on ethnic lines after the conflict between the tribal Kukis and non-tribal Meiteis broke out on May 3. Such actions create problems for the authorities, the Chief Secretary’s order said. “…it has come to the notice of the State government that many civil society organisations, institutions, establishments, and persons are deliberately renaming or trying to rename districts, sub-divisions, places, institutions, and address of such institutions,” the order said.“…these steps and actions are objectionable, or likely to create controversy and conflict between communities residing in the State, more particularly in the context of the ongoing law and order crisis [in the] aftermath [of] the Tribal Solidarity March organised by All Tribal Students Union Manipur on May 3,” it said.The State government, the order said, views the matter very seriously and with utmost sensitivity as it could create, divide, or aggravate the current law and order situation in Manipur.“Anyone found violating this order shall be prosecuted under relevant law of the land for the time being in force. All Central and State government authorities, management, institutions, establishment, autonomous bodies are also advised to check the name or address of respective offices/ establishments under them in all signage, official communications, websites, all documents related to services provided, etc., and also to ensure compliance of the orders,” the order said.The district magistrates and superintendents of police of all the districts have accordingly been asked to take necessary action to enforce the order.

"After promising a caste count in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, and vowing to release the caste data captured in 2015 in Karnataka soon, the Congress has now pledged to hold a caste survey in Madhya Pradesh, if it comes to power in the State. Speaking to reporters at the end of a three-hour long Congress Central Election Committee meeting, where the party deliberated over candidates for 130 to 140 seats, general secretary in-charge Randeep Surjewala said that the party’s primary agenda going into the Assembly election would be to conduct a caste count in the state.  “Ensuring justice for our brothers and sisters of the OBC (other backward class), SC (Scheduled Caste) and ST (Scheduled Tribe) communities is our primary agenda in Madhya Pradesh. A proper discussion on caste census was held and State chief Kamal Nath and other leaders informed [the CEC] that it will be our primary agenda in M.P.,” Mr. Surjewala said.Madhya Pradesh Congress president Kamal Nath said that the names of candidates for about 130 to 140 seats were discussed during the meeting. However, sources said that the party will announce the first list only after October 15. “We have held discussions on several names. No decision has been made yet but we have discussed about 130 to 140 seats. We will meet again and make a decision in six-seven days,” Mr. Nath told reporters.Mr. Surjewala reiterated that Mr. Nath was the obvious Chief Ministerial face of the party. “Kamal Nath is president of Madhya Pradesh Congress. Whoever is the president of State Congress, that person is naturally the face of the party,” he said. He contrasted the clarity in the Congress with the confusion in the BJP regarding its Chief Ministerial face. Incumbent CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan, he said, does not even know whether he will get a ticket this time around or not. “He [Mr. Chouhan] is now in danger which is why he has started to say all sorts of things now. He doubts whether he will contest from his constituency (Budhni) or not and whether Modi ji will give him a ticket or not,” he said. The Congress leader was hinting at some of Mr. Chouhan’s emotional speeches in the State in which he has asked the public whether he should contest the polls or not. The Congress is hoping that the anti-incumbency feeling against Mr. Chouhan, which had handed them victory in 2018, would work again in its favour. It has not lost a chance to underline the fact that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been publicly distancing himself from Mr. Chouhan. “Madhya Pradesh now wants a change. This is why the Prime Minister has now distanced himself from Shivraj ji’s name and deeds both out of fear. He even hesitates from taking his [Mr. Chouhan’s] name,” Mr. Surjewala said.The BJP has already declared its candidates for 79 seats. In an unprecedented move, the ruling party has fielded three Union Ministers and four Members of Parliament in the Assembly polls, which are expected to take place by the end of this year. ",1.0
"Ambai was born in Tamil Nadu in 1944, and secured a Ph D from Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi. She started writing in the 1960s and through the 1970s and the 1980s as the only feminist writer in Tamil. She had to face the flak from the literary world, then predominantly upper class and male. “She bore the heat over two long decades, there was so much trash talk and belittling, comments. Nevertheless, she carried on, steadfastly, until the 90s maybe, when she had some company among feminist writers,” Mr. Sundaram explains. The inimitable Lakshmi Holmstrom translated her works for the world outside the Tamil tongue. In fact, Mr. Sundaram points out, other than Perumal Murugan, Ambai is perhaps the only other Tamil writer to have their entire oeuvre translated into English. Thanks to the translations, a larger world came to be introduced to her writings, the world of her characters, the spaces they inhabit, their lingo, their peculiar situations in life, the quotidian, always enlightened with perspective, and sometimes, an invariably sharp tongue. Ambai herself, reportedly, famously, told one of her editors of an anthology with ill-concealed annoyance at the typical slotting of women writers: there is no need to specify that I am a woman writer. She had a range of characters, well fleshed out within the short confines of the format she loved, knew well, and cherished — the short story. Be it the love-lorn demon Mahishan or Thangam Athai who never ‘blossomed’ as a woman, the daughter-in-law Minakshi who seeks an extension of the kitchen, even the intrepid investigator Sudha Gupta, her characters are flesh and blood; the women may have agency or not, but there’s an underpinning of quiet rebellion, understanding of social structure, a tacit agreement with feminist thought, and repeatedly, they question the gender order.

"The biggest surprise in Hamas's massive attack on Israel this morning is that it was a surpriseThe operation was of unprecedented scale, involving thousands of personnel and pieces of equipment, from hang gliders to bulldozers and rocketsSuch an effort demands weeks if not months of preparation, and all of it took place under the nose of an Israeli intelligence service that has a deserved reputation as one of the most effective in the worldHow that happened is cause for deep embarrassment in Israel's security community and will prompt a painful internal investigationIsrael lost control of military outposts, armored vehicles and settlements, and the conflict is far from overDozens of Israeli citizens were killed, others were taken hostage and hundreds were injuredYet Saturday's assault was also an important reminder concerning HamasIt's a US-designated terrorist group but no band of hotheadsIt is a well-resourced organization with a paramilitary armed force that is as calculating as it is ruthlessThat's what kept it in control of Gaza since 2007 despite being under constant threat from Israel, as well as from still more radical Salafist and other Islamist groups within GazaOnly Hamas knows the details of its strategy for Saturday's attack, but the potential fallout is plain to seeA war in Gaza threatens at a stroke to upend the direction of travel in the Middle EastIt puts Israel in the invidious position of having to choose between appearing weak - a dangerous strategy in the region - and inflicting the kind of mass casualties in the crowded Gaza Strip that will enrage Israel's entire Palestinian population, forcing tough decisions on Arab leaders in the Gulf and beyondAlready on Saturday there were reports of 160 Palestinian dead and more than 1000 wounded in Israel's retaliatory airstrikesIsrael has had success normalizing relations with parts of the Arab world while supporting the expansion of Jewish settlements on the West Bank and, at best, slow walking prospects for Palestinian statehoodSince 2020, Israel has signed US-brokered recognition agreements with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and SudanSaudi Arabia, home to Mecca, has been considering a dealEven Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who for years had positioned himself as champion of the Palestinian cause for domestic political gain, met with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the first time last monthSaturday's calls from Erdogan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and others for de-escalation came quickly and were doubtless genuineAll of them know the political pressures they will come under to condemn and break ties with Israel if Palestinian casualties mountThat now seems inevitableNetanyahu said his country was at war, while Major General Ghasan Alyan said Hamas had ""opened the gates of hell to the Gaza strip,"" in a clip to camera posted on the Israeli Defense Forces' feed on X (formerly Twitter)Alyan went on to say that Hamas will bear responsibility for the consequences, but no matter how true that may be - and it is - the question of who fired first on Saturday will count for little in the Muslim worldThere, popular outrage over Israeli actions in recent months and years, in particular around the Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, had been mountingAlyan's words will resonate less than those of Mohammed Deif, a Hamas military commander, who said that ""Operation Al-Aqsa Flood"" was launched because ""enough is enough""Already, the Saudi government statement calling for calm on Saturday sought to position Hamas's actions as retaliatory, recalling the kingdom's ""repeated warnings of the dangers of the explosion of the situation, as a result of the continued occupation, the deprivation of the Palestinian people of their legitimate rights, and the repetition of systematic provocations against its sanctities""Hamas, which has never acknowledged Israel's right to exist, will have predicted and factored all this into its decision to attackI say this not because I have Deif's cell number, but because I have encountered the group's calculating natureIn 2011, I went to report in Gaza, unwittingly entering from Israel early on the morning that the US killed Osama bin LadenLater that day, a Hamas official approached to offer a six-man security detail or escort to the border, because they had picked up Salafists who were ""looking for the American journalist"" so they could make a videoI had a friend with Fatah intelligence connections check, and they confirmed the Hamas arrests, so I left GazaI retell this only because it was clear even from the security official who sat down with me that Hamas had no liking for US journalists, nor any moral issue with hosting an exemplary retaliation for Bin Laden's deathYet this was May 2011Hamas was in reconciliation talks with Fatah then, under international scrutiny and the group didn't want the kind of attention a video would drawNow, they do have a tactical interest in that kind of attentionEvents had not been going Hamas's way in recent years, and a Saudi-Israeli normalization would have been a major defeatHamas's aggression will boost its support base, and the appalling videos of Israeli casualties it organized to take on Saturday will help with recruitmentResponding to Hamas while keeping Israeli-Arab normalization on track will be extraordinarily difficult for Netanyahu to pull off, and the more so the longer the fighting continuesPromotedListen to thelatest songs, only onJioSaavncom(Marc Champion is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Europe, Russia and the Middle East)Disclaimer: These are the personal opinions of the author",1.0

You will become… MERCH!”I thought nothing of it of course, until the next day when friends pointed out that my tracking was offI looked in the mirror and sure enough, there were staticky white lines all over the top and bottom of my faceI raised my hand to wipe them away and realized I was wearing a Freddy Krueger glove, with a tag that read “Screen Quality replica – $245” I removed the glove only to find my hand had been replaced with a Korean laserdisc copy of “Chopping Mall” Slowly but surely, I was becoming niche memorabiliaAfter consulting with various experts in the paranormal, it is my hope that by proving I can be decisive, I will lift the curse and avoid my fate of becoming just another overpriced item on one of Madam Arcane’s kitschy shelvesIn an effort to cheat my macabre fate and preserve my humanity, here is my list of the best horror movies set in every USstate:Alabama: “Manhunter” (1986)Michael Mann’s adaptation of “Red Dragon,” the prequel to “The Silence of The Lambs” is stylish, kinetic and truly unnervingBrian Cox’s take on Hannibal Lecter is severely underrated, and character actor Tom Noonan is every bit as unsettling as he would go on to be in films like “The House of the Devil” I just threw up a bunch of creepy crawlersThere isn’t much timeAlaska: “30 Days of Night” (2007)Vampires wreak havoc on an isolated Alaskan town that experiences 30 straight days of darkness every winterIt’s an interesting premise that the film doesn’t quite live up to, but my right foot is now a Gizmo doll and I’m not sure if “The Grey” counts as horror so let’s move onArizona: “The Prophecy” (1995)Angered that God gave souls to man, an archangel played by Christopher Walken wages war in heaven, and seeks the ultimate weapon, which is a retired general in Arizona for some reasonIt’s a lot less scary now that I know catholicism is bogus and whatever religion that lady who cursed me follows is clearly the right oneArkansas: “The Town That Dreaded Sundown” (1976)Fun fact: The original Jason Voorhees costume from “Friday The 13th Part 2” is a direct ripoff of the killer in this movie, which is based on actual eventsNot so fun fact: My dick turned into a PinheadCalifornia: “Invasion of the Body Snatchers” (1978)There are a ton of horror movies set in LA, but none of them are quite as iconic as this San Fransisco-based remake of “Invasion of the Body Snatchers” The movie starts with a cozy ‘70s vibe which soon gives way to paranoia, an unhinged young Jeff Goldblum, and one of the most unnerving endings in film historyThere, I made my decisionPlease spirits, stop turning my thumb into a people-pod!Colorado: “The Shining” (1980)Easy pick here“The Shining” isn’t just considered one of the greatest horror movies of all time, it’s considered one of the greatest movies periodHey, I just got a shining from the witch lady who cursed meShe says this is a waste of time and I suckConnecticut: “The Innkeepers” (2011)There’s nothing more Connecticut than a small haunted hotel in a quaint little townBased on and primarily filmed in an allegedly haunted Inn in Torrington CT, Ty West’s “The Innkeepers” is an instant classic of New England horrorHey, spirits, can I have my penis back?Delaware: “Survival of the Dead” (2009)Not Romero’s best, arguably his worst in fact, but do you know how many movies are set in Deleware? Like fiveFlorida: “Day of the Dead” (1985)The worst entry of Romero’s initial Dead trilogy is still one of the best zombie movies ever madeIt can’t be said to really capture the essence of Florida since most of the movie takes place in an underground bunker, but then again if I had to live in Florida that’s where I would want to stay tooIn real life, there are worse things than zombies in the Sunshine StateGeorgia: “The Stuff” (1985)This B-movie classic is set in Georgia, and Michael Moriarty has the community theater-level southern accent to prove it!Continue Reading:12345",0

"SAN JOSE, Calif– Resident punk housecat Marigold keeps bringing Dead Kennedys merchandise to her owner and dropping it on her pillow every night, report confused residents who initially reached for mousetraps and pesticides“First it was a couple guitar picks that I thought were moths she’d killed — but they had this weird red and white design,” recalled Marigold’s owner Ashlyn Pierrette while delicately holding up two tooth-punctured picks bearing the band’s logo“Then she came in with a huge sock in her mouth that said ‘Bedtime for Democracy,’ so I started getting really worried about what she’s trying to tell me and what kind of crowd she’s been hanging out withYou know, it’s probably that feral tabby with the filthy fur that’s always lurking in our driveway”Pierrette’s friend Casey Lamoni, a longtime Dead Kennedys fan, applauded Marigold’s efforts to introduce her owner to the influential hardcare punk band“Ashlyn doesn’t listen to that kind of music and is basically the opposite of punk,” Lamoni explained“But I always knew that cat had good taste and solid politicsShe hates any toy that Ash buys for her because she rejects consumerismShe was absolutely an anti-establishment squatter before she got adoptedOne time when she coughed up a hairball, it even sounded like she was singing ‘kill, kill, kill, kill, kill the poor’”According to feline behaviorist Marc Burney, cats drop gifts on their owners’ pillows for many reasons, but most often to demonstrate their hunting skills or assert their political beliefs and music preferences“Whether it’s a decapitated rodent, a vegan soy-based rodent, or ‘Mutiny on the Bay’ 12” vinyl they’re presenting, this instinctual behavior is an evolutionary response,” Burney explained“Cats leave things on their owners’ beds to bond and send a messageYoung punk cats like Marigold, or ‘Mari Mayhem’ as she’s known around town, have a critical responsibility to spread awareness of the sceneThey’re working hard to encourage their owners to buy a record player and look into revolutionary politicsOr at least look up the name of the band”At press time, Marigold had begun spray painting “Nazi punks fuck off” on the wall of her litter box",0
"The Aquabats are really, really weird, and The Transplants/blink-182/+44/Colt 45’s Travis Barker used to drum for ‘em… Really! We know it doesn’t make a lot of sense, but deal with itThe Aquabats formed in 1994 in Huntington Beach, California, home of both Avenged Sevenfold and many proud members of the Alt-Right, and released their debut album, the cleverly named “The Return of the Aquabats” to underground acclaim to third wave ska-punk fans, past/future/present Comic-Con attendees, and droopy, drooly, driveling, and darn tootin’ dorks who also play D&D whilst chanting awkward and unintelligible sonnets like nerd icon Steve “Carl Winslow’s Biggest Fan” Urkel, but not the suave, sensual, sincere, and staggering beast, Stefan Urquelle6Kooky Spooky… In Stereo (2020)Longtime, casual and fair-weather fans of The Aquabats’ music, personas, stage clothes, and goofy, goofy banter likely don’t know too much about the band’s newest LP “Kooky Spooky… In Stereo” as it came out at the height of the pandemic, and we all had other things to think aboutStill, like its six predecessors, this LP puts the “enjo” in “enjoyable,” and this record is absolutely perfect for bubbly babies, acerbically witty adolescents, newly married twenty-somethings, and ne’er do well nursing homes sans Ben Stiller’s character in “Happy Gilmore” but with Wheel of Fortune’s letter turner Bob BarkerContinuing the sterling and sound tradition that the band started on their fourth studio album “Charge!,” the wild and crazy (The) Aquabats ended each song title with an exclamation point, and were happy to yell this at the sun in both bold and italic… They just want to party!Play it again:“No One Wants To Party!”Skip it:“She’s Gonna Live Forever!”5“Charge!!” (2005)The Aquabats’ fourth LP “Charge!!” actually doubles as a naval command and an Uber/Lyft shriek, and picks up where its odd-in-the-best way third/underrated record “The Aquabats vsthe Floating Eye of Death!” with an almost total upstroke elimination segueing into Devo territoryReleased on The Offspring and American Airlines’ Dexter Holland and the former Offspring bassist, Greg Kof Kmart’s now-defunct label Nitro Records, previous home to AFI, Crime in Stereo, formerly featuring current Aquabats guitarist Ian “Eagle ‘Bones’ Falconhawk” Fowles, who joined The Aquabats on their next wet release, “Hi-Five Soup!,” Son of Sam, and ColdBrew, this record served as a comeback to many misinformed dumbos who were turned off by its fantastic predecessorThe band released various compilations, EPs, and laserdiscs between album number three and four, and this LP had the longest gap between full-lengths until the year of our lord known as 2020Play it again:“Fashion Zombies”Skip it:“Mechanical Ape!”4Hi-Five Soup!

"SEATTLE — Multinational coffeehouse chain Starbucks rolled out a new seasonal offering to increase their market dominance of fall flavors with their new Wet Leaves Latte, excited sources confirmed“Our customers have spoken and they want more flavors to remind them the only time they are ever happy is during autumn,” explained Starbucks Chief Marketing Officer Marianne Jamieson, stirring a Wet Leaves Macchiato“To thank them for their support year after year, we are introducing exclusive items that no other chain would touchYou know that special earthy smell after the rain or the musty autumnal smell of wet wood, soil, and bugs? Now you can take it on the go so you can start every day thinking ‘I could use a sweater’ We are bringing the whole 360-degree seasonal experience to your sensesImagine a pile of leaves on a crisp October day, and now imagine falling into that pile with your mouth wide open”Reactions at Starbucks locations have been mixed, Tacoma employee Rodney Comstock spoke out against the menu addition“It’s such a freakin’ hassle, manWe run out of Wet Leaves mix at least twice a week and my manager expects me to grab a rake in order to get more flavoring from a field down the street,” said Comstock, while grinding a handful of leaves“I was working the morning shift when the Fall menu came back and people started streaming in to try the new drinkI still have PTSD, ya know? We had customers banging on the windows, and barricading the back door with a dumpsterI feared for my life”Starbucks product developers admit they are particularly proud of their latest creation“I like to think of myself as an artist, perhaps a translatorI interpret the essence of fall and whisper these secrets to your taste buds,” shared DrFern Larsen of the Starbucks Flavor Innovation Lab“The Wet Leaves line was a joy to create, identifying flavor notes of fungal dirt and trampled grassI’m particularly excited for next year when we debut our Hay-Flavored lineHay Cappuccino, Hay Espresso, and even the Hay Americano, which my mentors considered impossible to accomplishI like to source out initial flavor profiles myselfPersonally, hands-onThis means picking up only 100% organic matter during my long muddy walks, or just rifling through my neighbor’s gutter”At press time, Starbucks hinted they might finally release the much-rumored Frozen Rat Flat White, while bringing back the beloved Brackish Puddle Frappuccino this winter",0
